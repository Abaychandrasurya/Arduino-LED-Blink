# ðŸ”† Arduino LED Blink

This project demonstrates a simple LED sequencing pattern using an Arduino board. Four LEDs are connected to digital pins and turned on in a sequence with a delay, creating a basic visual effect.

## ðŸ“Œ Features

- Controls 4 LEDs (including the built-in LED)
- Simple delay-based sequencing
- Great for beginners to understand `digitalWrite()`, `pinMode()`, and `delay()`

## ðŸ§° Hardware Required

- Arduino Uno (or compatible)
- 3x external LEDs
- 3x 220Î© resistors
- Breadboard and jumper wires

## ðŸ”Œ Pin Configuration

| LED           | Arduino Pin |
|---------------|-------------|
| Built-in LED  | 13 (`LED_BUILTIN`) |
| LED 1         | 3           |
| LED 2         | 4           |
| LED 3         | 5           |
